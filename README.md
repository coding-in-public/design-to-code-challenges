### Functionality
- When a button is clicked, focused, or hovered, it should show as selected in the UI.
- Both buttons cannot be selected at the same time, so that clicking one should untoggle the other.
- The UI numbers should update accordingly:
  -  ‚Äú5 out of 6‚Äù if neither is selected
  -  ‚Äú6 out of 7‚Äù if the like button is selected
  -  ‚Äú5 out of 7‚Äù if the disliked button is selected

### Keep it üíØ Challenge (extra challenge)
- Add keyboard event listeners so you can toggle between the buttons with the right and left arrow keys.
